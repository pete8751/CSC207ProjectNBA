This project is an NBA Fantasy League that allows users to build their own NBA team, and compare their team against other users in the fantasy league. Users get live updates on their teams' current performance in the league, and their overall score is 
calculated by a custom algorithm. Live player statistics are recieved from the APINBA API (RapidAPI). Users must login to create their own teams, and appear on the standings, and after logging in, users can also additionally compare their teams 
to others using a more detailed team statistic breakdown. Users can also see the statistics of their players visualized on a graph. 

This project was built collaboratively by a team of 5 of which I was a key contributor. It was built using the clean architecture and SOLID principles, as can be seen from the file arrangement.
